# TreeExercises
Here is an exercise about trees which I've done at Data Structures Class.
## The exercise:
### 1. Given a binary tree, write a Java program that determines if the binary tree is balanced.*(See my solution in `Balanced.java`)*
### 2. Given a binary tree and a value x, check the given tree has paths that its value is equal to the given value x. The path value is calculated from the values of nodes of the given tree by traversing the tree from root to leaf. If there are paths, write the node positions from root to leaf.*(See my solution in `Path.java`)*
